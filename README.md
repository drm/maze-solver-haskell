# Haskell solution to the maze solver 'dev-challenge'

To run this, you need `ghc` (or `runhaskell`) plus the `JuicyPixels` library.

On a Debian machine, you can get these from the repositories:

```
sudo apt-get install ghc libghc-juicy-pixels
```

After this, you can either run with `runhaskell` or compile and run using `ghc maze.hs && ./maze`
